d3-dependency-parse-tree
========================

This is a friendly fork of [sobhe/dependency-parse-tree](https://github.com/sobhe/dependency-parse-tree), a D3.js based visualization for dependency parse trees. Their live demo is available [here](http://www.sobhe.ir/dependency-parse-tree/).

Changes
-------

* changed default word order to left-to-right (the original library was implemented for Persian depency parses)
* changed input format to [CoNLL2009](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/conll2009-st/task-description.html)
* played a bit with width/height parameters (German words are loooong)
